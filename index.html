    <p>Table tennis, also known as ping pong, is a fast-paced and highly competitive sport that has gained immense popularity worldwide, particularly in countries such as China, Germany, and South Korea. Played on a rectangular table divided by a net, the game involves two or four players hitting a lightweight ball back and forth using small, solid rackets. The objective is to score points by making the ball land on the opponent's side of the table in a manner that prevents a valid return. Known for its quick reflexes, precision, and strategic play, table tennis demands excellent hand-eye coordination and agility. The sport's accessibility and relatively low equipment costs make it popular in schools, recreational centers, and professional arenas alike. Major competitions such as the World Table Tennis Championships and the Olympic Games showcase the highest levels of talent and attract a global audience, further cementing table tennis as a beloved sport with a rich history and a vibrant international community.</p>
